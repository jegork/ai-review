## Pull requests

- Open an issue first for anything beyond a small bug fix — alignment before implementation saves time.
- Keep PRs focused; one logical change per PR.
- Add or update tests for changed behaviour.
- The pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` (ESLint + Prettier) and the full test suite. Fix failures before pushing.
- PR titles should follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `perf:`.
